# CISSP review
Welcome to the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) Review Course offered by (ISC)2. The purpose of this course is to help you determine whether you are ready to pursue the CISSP certification. The CISSP Review Course will allow you to assess your level of preparedness to begin the intensive study required to pursue the CISSP certification exam.

This course will introduce you to the topics relevant to the certification and the exam. These topics are drawn from the exam outline, which specifies the knowledge required to hold the credential. The content covered in this course reflects topics that are in the exam outline and is intended to help you determine your own strengths and weaknesses as it relates to these topics.

In order to present the material to you in an efficient, straightforward manner, we’ve broken down the Exam Outline into seven (7) topics and arranged them in an efficient and intuitive order. We’ve grouped subject areas based on their similarity and ordered them in a manner that allows earlier material to build up to content later in the course.

We hope you find this content helpful in deciding whether you’re ready to sit for the CISSP examination, and we wish you the very best of luck in your studies!

### CIA Triad
Throughout our industry, the CIA triad is used to convey the intent and goals of information security efforts. The triad comprises these three ideas:

Confidentiality: Protecting data from unauthorized view
Integrity: Protecting data from unauthorized modification
Availability: Ensuring data can be accessed in authorized manner, as permitted
You will need to know the intent of each element of the CIA triad, as well as the mechanisms used to achieve those intentions.
